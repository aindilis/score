# by the Grace of God, willing:


# we can collect key functionality and add to this system

# we can transition from score to PSE for more logical alignment (simply rename score, pse?)




# we can ensure the morality of our goals

# we can ensure the logical consistency of our goals

# we can ensure the fidelity of our goals

# we can ensure the accuracy of our goals


# we can relate key goals via our goal relation system



# we can eliminate outdated goals, or goals that are no longer
# necessary

# we can ensure consistency between unilang and score databases
#  identify duplicates
#

# we can record when a goal is judged as complete and what if any is
# our evidence of this

# we can formalize the goals so they make more sense to our other systems
