We want to get this thing so that it will do a number of things.

Firstly, we want to test that it can execute a function.

After that,  have it get goals  from PSE or  something, in otherwords,
planning.

Based on these higher level goals, plan out all other activities for
the duration of a cycle.

Also plan the cycles end.

Write a domain for being in contact with someone.  For battery power etc.

Then have it plan its own planning at the end.
