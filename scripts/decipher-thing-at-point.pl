# store the thing to a file and run file on it
# use a language analyzer if it is a sentence

# inference rules develop as many assertions as possible about the
# thing that you are looking at

# use the memory storage  implementation to implement the theorems for
# looking up what this thing is, and use the inference rules

# store the run time parameters of each operation, so that the program
# can decide what it may be

# decide in what context we are reading

# if it is a file, use kbfs to cache the file type, and any other
# assertions about the file, and if it is not too long open the file
# and parse it with the available parser if it is a descrete type
# (like a shell script or something).  if it is a comment, then it is
# still and instance of a natural language statement.
